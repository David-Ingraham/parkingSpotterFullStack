=== DEV/PROD SWITCHING GUIDE ===

🔄 **Switch to PRODUCTION mode:**
1. Edit `frontEnd/.env`:
   ```
   #BACKEND_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000
   BACKEND_URL=https://parkingspotterbackend.onrender.com
   ```

2. Set keystore environment variables in PowerShell:
   ```
  
   ```

3. Build release APK:
   ```
   cd frontEnd
  >>>>>wrong command  npx react-native run-android --variant=release
   ```

🔄 **Switch to DEVELOPMENT mode:**
1. Edit `frontEnd/.env`:
   ```
   BACKEND_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000
   #BACKEND_URL=https://parkingspotterbackend.onrender.com
   ```

2. Run debug build:
   ```
   cd frontEnd
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

=== OLD NOTES ===

All environment variables secured - Let's check for any .env files in your repo
Input validation implemented - Need to check your route handlers
Error handling doesn't expose internals - Need to review error responses
Database access restricted - Check if you have proper query parameterization

merge the back and frontedn repos

get user coords back to sceen in nearest screen, not currently working but the geofixing is tricky 

can we make request to the dot api from the frontend? how much should be split for optimal perfmorance?
easy to do diret search bc
